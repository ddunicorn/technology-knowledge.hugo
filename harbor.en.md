[Harbor](https://goharbor.io/) is an [Open Container Initiative (OCI)](https://opencontainers.org/) compliant artifact registry. Such a registry is used to save and distribute data, usually build artifacts, and in particular OCI images ("docker images"). Harbor also supports vulnerability scanning and proxy caching of other public or private registries like Docker Hub.

Harbor is FOSS and a CNCF Graduated Project.
