[Forgejo](https://forgejo.org/) is an open‑source, self‑hosted Git service that originated as a fork of Gitea. It provides repository hosting, pull requests, issue tracking, wikis and CI/CD pipelines while staying completely free and community‑driven.

Key highlights:

– released under the MIT license, with all code publicly available for audit and contribution
– supports pull requests, code reviews, project boards, built‑in CI, LDAP/OAuth authentication
– easy to deploy via Docker, binary releases or package managers, which give you full control over data and infrastructure
– no telemetry or ads

Forgejo is ideal for teams or organizations that need a robust, extensible Git platform without **vendor lock‑in**, while staying fully within the open‑source ecosystem.
