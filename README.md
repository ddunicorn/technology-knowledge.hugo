This repo is our growing collection of short and precise presentations of

- Technology we use and trust
- Technical terms you may find in the news

From spinning up infrastructure to deploying AI models, these are the tools we rely on every day.

We created this list to:
- Share what’s working well for us 🧪

We’re big believers in open ecosystems, and this is our way of giving a little signal boost to the projects making that possible.
