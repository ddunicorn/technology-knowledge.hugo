[Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/) is a non‑profit, open‑source platform for hosting Git repositories, wikis and issue trackers. It is built on [Forgejo](https://forgejo.org/) and aims to provide a privacy‑respectful alternative to commercial services.

The key points can be summarised as the following:

- the service is hosted by a non‑profit organization
- there is no tracking, minimal data collection and strong GDPR compliance
- it supports pull requests, code review, CI/CD integrations, project boards and wiki pages
