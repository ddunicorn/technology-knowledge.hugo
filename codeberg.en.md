[Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/) is a non‑profit, open‑source platform for hosting Git repositories, wikis and issue trackers. It is built on [Gitea](https://about.gitea.com/) and aims to provide a privacy‑respectful alternative to commercial services.

The key points can be summarised as the following:

- the entire stack runs is free and open source and runs under the MIT license and the service itself is hosted by a non‑profit organization
- there is no tracking, minimal data collection and strong GDPR compliance
- it supports pull requests, code review, CI/CD integrations, project boards and wiki pages

Codeberg is a great choice for teams and individuals who want a self‑hosted‑feel with open‑source tooling for collaborative development.
